## Intro
I created this simple todo list for a live React crash course that i hosted with [GDG Sousse](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Sousse/).
Here is the link to the live session if you'd like to follow the tutorial: https://youtu.be/PCNOKpgnde8 (In Tunisian Arabic)<br />

Please note that data fetching and app responses to actions may take few seconds as I used [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for fake Online REST API 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
